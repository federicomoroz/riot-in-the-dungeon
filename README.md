RIOT IN THE DUNGEON
Unity Engine 2020.3.25f1

This is a prototype of a retro "32bits" style 3d magic shooter with tank controls. Player can shoot magic blasts.
There are three magic types: Fire, Ice, Dark.

There are three basic enemies: Troll, Ghost, Dragon.

Each enemy has resistance and a weakness to magic types.

Trolls are weak to fire and resist dark.
Ghosts are weak to dark and resist ice.
Dragons are weak to ice and resist fire. 

Power ups randomly spawned on the stage switch magic type to its specific type and fill magic ammo.
